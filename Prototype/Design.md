<h4>Old design for Case</h4>
<p>It contained curved structures and an additional platform on top for the SRA board<br>
Our second design was modeled in the same way and modified from there accordingly</p>

<p>The new changes made to the design were to make the surfaces flat and reduce the number of unncecssary structures that would cause manufacturing difficulties</p>

<p>The old leg design contained unneccesary curves which pu strain on their structure. Along with that the joints in the old design were not proper as well</p>

<p>Along with eliminating the curves, a sandwich leg design is implemented</p>
