<h3>Underactuated</h3>
<p>It is used to describe mechanical systems that cannot be commanded to follow arbitrary trajectories in configuration space.<br>
This mostly happens when the system has a lower number of actuators than degrees of freedom.<br>
Thats is all the joints present are not actuated.</p>

<h3>Fullyactuated</h3>
<p>Here, the system has equal number of actuators and degress of freedom.<br>
All joints are actuated, i.e. Every joint has a motor.</p>

<p>Our robot will have an underactuated system.</p>
